Welcome to GitHub! This is a Markdown file with important information.

To complete this assignment:

1. Add your file from the servo lab part 1.4 and commit it to the repository. Don't forget to add a commit message!

2. Update this README.md file with your name and email address (see above). Commit it with a commit message.

3. Push your changes to the repository on the server. GitHub Desktop makes this fairly straightforward.
